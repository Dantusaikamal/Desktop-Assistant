<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->
## About The Project

![Alt Text](https://s4.gifyu.com/images/JARVIS-gif-1.gif)

I've created a desktop assistant and named it J.A.R.V.I.S which makes our day to day task much easier. It is capable of doing various tasks and I'll be adding more functions soon :)

** List of commands:**


1. wikipedia + 'query':

```
Say wikipedia and wait for a second. Now say what you want J.A.R.V.I.S to search in Wikipedia.
```

2. Open YouTube

```
This command will open YouTube from your default browser
```

3. Open Gmail

```
This command will open Gmail from your default browser
```

4. Open Google + 'query'

```
Say Google and wait for a second. Now say what you want J.A.R.V.I.S to search in Google.
```

5. The Time

```
Says out current time in your system
```

6. Send mail to 'user'
```
Define who you want to send in the code in the send mail section first.
Say mail to 'user' and wait for a second.
Say the content of the mail
```
7. Open desktop applications (VS Code, Spotify, etc!)
```
Open which ever desktop application you want by specifying the app's name in the code and it's complete path. Check out Open Code and Open Spotify commands for more information on how to open desktop applications
```
8. J.A.R.V.I.S sleep
```
When you no longer want J.A.R.V.I.S to answer you, simply say Jarvis sleep.
```

These are the commands for J.A.R.V.I.S in the initial version. More and more commands will be added soon!
